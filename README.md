## üéØ Product Overview
- **Inventory Management**
Users can manage and list all their inventory items in their household or warehouse. They can add item details such as name, category, price, brand, placement, and availability status.

- **Manage Placement**
Users can create a floor map of their rooms and specify the exact location of each item within those rooms.

- **Inventory Analysis**
Based on the input data, users can view various charts and summaries of their inventory, providing valuable insights for item maintenance and management.

- **Inventory Report**
Items can be grouped and included in reports that function as shopping lists, daily maintenance checklists, or travel packing lists. Reports can also be exported as PDFs or further analyzed.

- **Exported Dataset**
Users can export their data in Excel or PDF format for personal use and management.

- **Reminder**
Each item in the inventory can have reminders set, allowing users to schedule dates for usage, maintenance, or other important actions.

## üöÄ Target Users

1. **Homeowners & Renters**
Individuals or families who want to organize and manage household items, track where things are stored, schedule maintenance, and set reminders for tasks like restocking or repairs.

2. **Small Business Owners**
Owners of small shops, cafes, or home businesses who need to monitor stock levels, manage item placements, and generate reports for inventory and supply tracking.

3. **Office Administrators**
Personnel responsible for managing office supplies, equipment, and assets who benefit from reminders, placement tracking, and regular reporting.

4. **Collectors & Hobbyists**
Users with personal collections‚Äîlike tech gadgets, art, or memorabilia. Who want to catalog their items, note item conditions, and receive upkeep reminders.

## üß† Problem to Solve

1. People often **forget where their items are placed**, especially in large households or warehouses, leading to **wasted time** and **frustration** when searching for them.  
2. It's difficult to **track the condition, value, and usage** of items over time, which causes **inefficient maintenance** and **unexpected replacements**.  
3. Without a centralized system, users often rely on **scattered notes or memory** for inventory and reminders, resulting in **disorganization**.  
4. Creating **manual reports or packing lists** for shopping, maintenance, or travel is **time-consuming** and prone to **errors**.  
5. Users lack tools to **analyze inventory trends** or **export data**, making it hard to gain **insights** or **share structured information**.

## üí° Solution

1. Provide a way to **digitally map item placements** within rooms or warehouses, so users can quickly **locate items** using floorplans and visual markers.  
2. Let users add **detailed item metadata** such as name, category, price, brand, and condition, and schedule **reminders** for maintenance, usage, or expiry.  
3. Offer a **cross-platform solution** (Web, Mobile, Telegram, and Line) that allows users to **sync and manage data seamlessly**.  
4. Include tools to **generate and export reports** (e.g., shopping lists, maintenance checklists, packing guides) in **PDF or Excel formats**.  
5. Visualize inventory with **charts, summaries, and analytics**, helping users make **data-driven decisions** about their assets.

## üìù Notes & Limitations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Precautions When Using the Service
- Ensure API endpoints requiring authentication are protected with proper middleware.
- Do not expose sensitive environment variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in public repositories.
- Avoid using seeded dummy data in production environments.
- Avoid using seeded dummy data with large seed at the same time.

### üß± Technical Limitations
- Telegram & Line bot polling may cause delays or downtime if the server experiences high load

### üêû Known Issues
- Limitation when using Firebase Storage for free plan Firebase Service, upgrade to Blaze Plan to use more.
